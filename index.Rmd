# Dependencies 

**qsubshcom**\
Sections of the code in **bash** may be run directly on a high performance cluster thanks to the **qsubshcom** piece of software. (<https://github.com/zhilizheng/qsubshcom>)  
In short, **qsubshcom** is a job submission wrapper that adapts automatically to the cluster system, which makes our code highly portable: you only need to set up a few paths (see below) and run on you cluster. 

Steps that do not require much time/memory were sometimes run in an interactive session (they come without the **qsubshcom** syntax) 

**FreeSurfer 6.0**\
Image processing requires FreeSurfer 6.0 (<https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/>). 

**ENIGMA-shape**\
Subcortical processing further requires the scripts developped by Boris Gutman for the ENIGMA consortium (<http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/protocols/imaging-protocols/>).

**OSCA**\
Most of the mixed model analyses were performed using the **OSCA** software (<https://cnsgenomics.com/software/osca/#Overview>). 

**R**\
Plots, some data management and penalised regression (LASSO) were performed using R version 3.3 to 3.6. See manuscript (or code) for full list of packages used.

# Atlas files

We created a bunch of files to facilitate the analysis. They may be used to prune out vertices outside of the cortex or to relate each vertex to a cortical/subcortical region.
They are available in the **atlas** folder of this repository.
